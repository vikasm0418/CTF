This was similar to auth_token problem. The difference was our a)we had to make a password file with having read permisions b)input was getting compared to certain hex value. Converted the hex to int and gave it as an input to the program after creating password file which proceeds the program further. Here, we had to change th definition of ls. Update it in $PATH environment variable. and change the permission of all the files in the path provided.(chmod 777 works just fine).The script for ls is provided along.
