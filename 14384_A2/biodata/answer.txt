Here, return to libc attack worked fine. we had to do overflow and overwriting with address of system then exit and passing argument check(a envrionment variable we defined).
	check = cat /home/vikasm/ctf2/biodata/flag.txt
We had to pass the appropriate address in our input string. Change of permissions of all folders was also required. This resulted in required flag. check.txt files has the required address.
