First we check if the input fileds are vulnerable to sql injection. The password got verified with the stored hash and salt. So what we need to do is provide a query that such that we can bypass verification.query = vikasm' UNION select id, 'a73fcf339640929207281fb8e038884806e2eb0840f2245694dbba1d5cc89e65', 'a' FROM users WHERE username = 'vikasm in the username field and password=1 does the job for us. It works becoz we are manuallyy providing the salt and hash in the query itself. Now Once we gets logged in we see a qr code image. Also, if we look up at port 8020 we find that an input string generates similar images. So all we need to do now is find the string(flag) which results in the image what we obtained. Wrote a script to do the same. The script basically takes a string of input length 40 traverse it and modifies characters and for any particular position selects the character which results in maximum similarity between the two images and similarly further for all positions.
