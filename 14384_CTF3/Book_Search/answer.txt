We first check if the query is vulnerable to sql injection. Now we try to gain information about the database tabel, total columns, column names using various sql injection attempts. FInally we see that when we use search for 'cs628{' like string in author column "wow there's a book message" is displayed. Which means we just need to search the entire flag in the author column. Wrote a script to do the same and obtained the required flag.
