By using brute force (given in script captain.py) found the password for my teamid. Once we get logged in we need to gain admin access. This can be done by changing the cookies. Changing user to admin from vikasm and hash value to md5(reverse(admin)) from that of md5(reverse(vikasm)) gives us the admin access. Once done that a security question is asked for favourite fruit. Again using brute force and putting all possible answer we find that alphonso is the required answer. The we get a message that a secret is hidden which is nothing but code written in white space language. Opening a white space interpreter and passing the message through it results in the required flag.
