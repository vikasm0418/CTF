Analyzing the assembly code here was a bit complex.however, it could be seen that there was a coamprison from an address in stak pointer with 0x0 which always eqauted and never in a jump and the program exited. Hence, an hit and trial method of buffer overflow was all that was required to obtain the flag since it overwrote some value at that that address (the once which was compared from stack pointer so that jump is taken) due to concurrent memory allocation .
