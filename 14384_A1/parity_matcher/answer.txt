Here, the catch was understanding 8-1-1 odd parity. After some research found out how even parity and odd parity is used for error checking. the first and last bits never changed so after removing them what we are left with is odd parity and data. wrote a script(debug.py) to check if the bits recived are correct by counting total no. of 1s in the data if they are odd correct data was recieved else retransmit the bit.The script gives us result of all the correct binary bits which on converting to string results in the flag.
