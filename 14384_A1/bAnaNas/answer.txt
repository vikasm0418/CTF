Here, while analyzing the code using gdb and checking values stored in eax and other registers while stepping through each instruction i realized that whatever the input was given it was multiplied with value 10 and the compared with 4 if the value was equal it printed the flag else exited. Now the catch here was that we need to input a number which on multyplying by 10 yields value 4. Since, EAX is a 32 bit register we need to input a very large number such that least significant bit equal 100 and other bit equal 0 except some most significant bits so that when it multiplies with 10 the value get overflows and and the result stored in register equates to 4 and the program prints the flag.
