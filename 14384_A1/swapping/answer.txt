This was somewhat a similar problem to forgot-pass. So on analyzing the dissasemle code we find that required no. of times chemical was messed was hardcoded to a certain value. The hex value of this no. was later compared with the input and if the value matched it called the getflag function and revealed the flag else the program exits giving output that wrong guess.In my case the hex value was 0x7cfb which is 31995 in decimal(address = 804868c).Now all we need to do is run the program, input 31995 and obtain the required flag.
