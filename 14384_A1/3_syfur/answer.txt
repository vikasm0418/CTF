After carefully analyzing the assembly code we can see that not_flag function which outputs the required flag was never getting called.The code always call the get_flag function and then exits.Now, that means we need to call the not_flag function forcefully.But we only have input string in our hand.So might be some buffer overflow trick will be used.So from some youtube videos and other sources studied about how variables and other return address are stored in stack and how it can be exlpoited . All we needed to do is put such a large string in buffer such that it ovrewrites the return address in the stack. Now , the address that gets overwritten should be that of not_flag function so that it gets called and desired flag is obtained. For this we need to append the address of not_flag to a grabage string of definite offset(which can be found by with a large string input) aand this should be our final input string.
Note: Used pwn library for finding the appropriate address in string format.The script to do this attached along.Also, the explaination for Bob-pet is mostly similar.
