This seemed comparitevely simple question where a knowledge of weak keys in DES algorithm was required. Researched about it and from wikipedia found out that it has 4 weak keys which cause the encryption mode of DES to act identically to the decryption mode of DES. Did an hit and trial method with all the four keys on our given cipher by using an online DES decypter which resulted in the required flag.
